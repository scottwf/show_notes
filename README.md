# ShowNotes
Your plex television companion
## Overview

ShowNotes is a Flask-based web app that helps users explore TV shows, character arcs, and actor overlap between series. It offers spoiler-aware summaries, relationship mapping, chat-style interaction, and integration with metadata sources like local installations of Radarr, Sonarr, Bazarr, Tautulli and Ollama.

The purpose of ShowNotes is to be a tool for exploring tv show, season and character summaries, overlap detection, actor insights, and spoiler-aware recaps based on viewing progress. Using a plex webhook the plex users' viewing is imported and stored in a sqlite3 database for each user. Using Jellyseer as inspiration for layout and visual deesign to be usable on a phone and computer. Also use plex autentication to sign in for an administrator and users.

## 🆕 Recent Improvements

### Admin Panel & Service Management
- **Dynamic Service Status:** The admin services page (`/admin/settings`) now features real-time status indicators.
  - On page load, dots are colored green or red based on an initial connection test.
  - Clicking the "Test" button for any service triggers a live API check and updates the dot color instantly without a page reload.
- **New Admin Panel UI:** Introduced a dedicated admin section (`/admin/dashboard`) with a responsive sidebar and a new dashboard page. The service configuration page is now part of this new layout.
- **Admin Tasks Page & Sync Enhancements:** Introduced a dedicated Admin Tasks page (`/admin/tasks`) for Sonarr and Radarr library synchronization. This includes:
    - Clearer separation of sync actions.
    - User feedback via flash messages indicating the number of shows/movies processed.
    - Consistent UI styling for sidebar links (e.g., 'Tasks' link) and action buttons.
    - Corrected logo display for Sonarr/Radarr in both light and dark modes on the tasks page.
- **Plex Integration:** Resolved Plex OAuth login/logout flows, session management. Enhanced Plex webhook handling to capture detailed events (play, pause, resume, stop, scrobble) into a new `plex_activity_log` table. The homepage now displays "Now Playing" or "Recently Played" information for the logged-in user based on this detailed log.
- **Search Image Handling:** Fixed display of Sonarr/Radarr images in search results by ensuring absolute URLs are used and API keys are included for image fetching and caching.

### UI & Styling
- **Tailwind CSS & Dark Mode:** The entire application uses Tailwind CSS for styling, including full dark mode support.
- **Dynamic Logos:** All service logos on the admin page support both light and dark modes with automatic switching.
- **API Key Links:** Links for Sonarr, Radarr, and Bazarr now point directly to the relevant settings page within those applications.

### Static Asset Serving
- Static files are served from `/app/static` using Flask’s best practices.
- All static asset references use `url_for('static', filename=...)`.

### Development Setup
- **Requirements:** Python 3.x, Node.js (v18+), npm (v9+)
- **Tailwind Build:**
  ```bash
  npx tailwindcss -i ./app/static/input.css -o ./app/static/css/style.css --watch
  ```
- **Run the app:**
  ```bash
  python3 run.py
  ```
- **Automated Development Server (with Watchdog & Tailwind)**

For a more robust development setup that includes automatic Flask server restarts on Python file changes and simultaneous Tailwind CSS watching, an advanced configuration using `systemd`, `tmux`, and `watchmedo` is available.

This setup provides:
- Automatic restart of the Flask development server when `.py` files are modified.
- Continuous Tailwind CSS compilation in watch mode.
- Both processes managed by a single `systemd` service for easy start/stop/monitoring.

**For detailed setup instructions, please refer to: [`docs/dev-server-watchdog.md`](docs/dev-server-watchdog.md)**

Once configured, you can monitor the live output of both Flask and Tailwind using:
```bash
tmux attach -t shownotes
```

## API Integration

### TMDB API
- Used for metadata and casting.
- Fetches show information, cast lists, images (posters/backdrops), and descriptions.
- Key functions: `search_tmdb()`, `get_cast()`, `get_known_for()`, `get_show_backdrop()`.

### Ollama API
- Used for character summaries and in-character replies (GPT-4).
- Generates structured character summaries and enables chat functionality.
- Key functions: `get_character_summary()`, `chat_as_character()`.
- All API calls are tracked in the SQLite database (`api_usage` table) for cost monitoring.
- Prompts are built using templates from `app/prompts.py` or `app/prompt_builder.py`.

- Integration via webhooks to track viewed episodes.
- The `/plex-webhook` route handles incoming POST requests when an episode is watched.
- Updates `current_watch` table and `webhook_log` table.
- This data can be used to adjust spoiler levels for summaries.
- **Plex OAuth login** using PIN-based flow. Credentials are securely stored in the database, not in .env files.
- **Webhook event display:** Homepage shows the most recent relevant activity (play, pause, resume, stop, scrobble) for the logged-in user, sourced from the `plex_activity_log` table, including rich metadata and poster image.

### Sonarr
- Used to retrieve upcoming episode schedules for a calendar view.
- Use the show metadata import into Shownotes
- The `/calendar/full` endpoint is intended to serve this data.
- `fetch_sonarr_calendar()` function in `app/sonarr_calendar.py`.

### Radarr
- Use Radarr API to import movie metadata into Shownotes and display upcoming movie releases

### Bazarr
- Use Bazarr API to insert subtitles to the Shownotes DB for the user to search and the LLM to add context.

## Database

The application uses an SQLite database (typically `data/shownotes.db` or `db.sqlite3`). No ORM is used; queries are generally raw SQL.

-   **`current_watch`**: Tracks the latest episode watched per user (from Plex webhooks).
-   **`webhook_log`**: Records a minimal log of every Plex webhook event received (older table).
-   **`plex_activity_log`**: Stores detailed information for various Plex webhook events (e.g., `media.play`, `media.pause`, `media.resume`, `media.stop`, `media.scrobble`), including `event_type`, `plex_username`, `media_type`, `title`, `show_title`, `season_episode`, `player_uuid`, `session_key`, `view_offset_ms`, `duration_ms`, `event_timestamp`, and `raw_payload`.
-   **`autocomplete_logs`**: Records when a user selects an autocomplete suggestion.
-   **`plex_events`**: Older table for basic Plex play events (largely superseded by `plex_activity_log` for detailed tracking but kept for some historical context or specific uses).

### Database Initialization
Tables are created automatically the first time you run the database initialization command.
Run the following to create a fresh SQLite database:

```bash
FLASK_APP=shownotes.run flask init-db
```

This command sets up all tables defined in `app/database.py`.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install flask requests
   ```

2. **Initialize the SQLite database**
   ```bash
   FLASK_APP=shownotes.run flask init-db
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   python -m shownotes.run
   ```

## Development Guide

### Developer Notes
-   Modular logic for summaries, relationship formatting, and OpenAI calls lives in `app/utils.py`.
-   Character and show summaries can be cached in the database to reduce API calls (see Database section).
-   Admin tools are available at `/admin` .
-   `shownotes.service` (for systemd) restarts the app automatically if it crashes.
-   Run `FLASK_APP=shownotes.run flask init-db` to create the database schema.

### Prompt Templates
-   Prompt templates are structured in `app/prompts.py` or `app/prompt_builder.py`.
-   Example structure:
    ```python
    SUMMARY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
    Provide a character summary for {character} from {show}, up to Season {season}, Episode {episode}.
    Include:
    - A short character bio
    - A quote that captures their personality
    - A section titled “Significant Relationships” formatted as a bulleted list. Each bullet should name the person, identify their role, and include a short description.
    """
    ```
-   Prompts can be easily adjusted to include other attributes like motivations, key arcs, or symbolic moments.

### OpenAI or Ollama API Usage & Cost Tracking
-   All API calls to OpenAI are tracked in the SQLite database table: `api_usage`.
-   Columns include: `id`, `timestamp`, `endpoint`, `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens`, `cost_usd`.
-   A dashboard is under development at `/admin/usage` (or `/admin/api-usage`) to view and export cost breakdowns.
-   Use `utils.log_openai_usage()` (or similar, function name might vary) to log calls programmatically.
-   To keep costs low, batch prompts when possible and cache results for repeated queries.
